NSCC Web Programming 
Full Stack Programming - Final project 

## Objective
Build on the concepts covered in Client Side Programming by progressing into advanced JavaScript frameworks (React) to develop full stack scalable web applications. A heavy focus is placed on the development and testing of web apps throughout all layers (client side,server side, etc.). Learners will have demonstrated the ability to:
1. Develop the front-end of a full stack application using an advanced JavaScript framework(s).
2. Develop the back-end services (RESTful/Micro) of a full stack application implementing industry relevant server side technologies.
3. Develop and manage a SQL or NoSQL data layer for a full stack application.
4. Demonstrate effective testing of the multiple layers of a full stack application.
5. Deploy a finished full stack web application to a public server.
